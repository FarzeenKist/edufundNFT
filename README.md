# **edufundNFT**

## OVERVIEW
#### edufundNFT is an NFT project use to fund educational projects and facilities in less developed nations. 
#### Education  financing has been a problem in less developed countries. UNESCO outlined three major sources of education financing in Africa which include public financing by the government, external assistance from developed countries and innovative financing which is related to private public partnership. I believe blockchain network can be very useful here as a form of innovative financing. Imagine a dapp where the administrator creates NFTs bearing the images of various aspects of education that can be financed by users as well as cordinates of the proposed or existing educational institution.
#### The various aspects that the NFT will bear include but not limited to classrooms, furniture, toilets, sport facilities, music facilities, and access to premium online resources. Blockchain is best for this scenario because if a centralised network is used as opposed to blockchain ,hence DAO,the administrator can embezzle the fund for personal gain. More so, a hack into the system which has one point of failure will be very devastating.

## DAPP FUNCTIONALITIES
#### -The ability of the administrator to mint and  list an NFT
#### -Ability of a user to buy an NFT, hence fund an educational facility.
#### -Ability of a user to re-list the token at a cost which goes to the administrator.
#### -Ability of the user to receive some fund when his relisted NFT is bought by another user.
#### Note that the first version of this dapp include the first functionality the other three functionalities shall be incorparated in later versions.

#### In conclusion, the fund realised from the sale of these NFTs will be used to fund educational facilities in developing nations. It would also include a DAO where users can vote for the educational facility that should be funded after receiving and scrutinizing proposals from existing and proposed educational institutions for funding. More so, the actual disbursement of the fund will be overseen by members of the DAO who will be chosen democratically through a public vote. Lastly, all disbursed fund will be made public for members' scrutiny.
